Without even knowing it at first, he was playing his business consulting role, confronting me with key questions that literally illuminated my path.\n\nThanks to his involvement and his listening, I was able to identify an optimal approach for evolving Voixlibre. This chance encounter was not only enriching but also decisive for my project.\n\nI highly recommend Baptiste to anyone or any organization looking for a perceptive, curious and stimulating strategic advisor. He is a person of rare human and professional quality."
